description: "The Job is an early work by American novelist Sinclair Lewis. It is\
  \ considered an early declaration of the rights of working women. The focus is on\
  \ the main character, Una Golden, and her desire to establish herself in a legitimate\
  \ occupation while balancing the eventual need for marriage. The story takes place\
  \ in the early 1900-1920s and takes Una from a small Pennsylvania town to New York.\
  \ Forced to work due to family illness, Una shows a talent for the traditional male\
  \ bastion of commercial real estate and, while valued by her company, she struggles\
  \ to achieve the same status of her male coworkers.\nOn a parallel track, her quest\
  \ for traditional romance and love is important but her unique role as a working\
  \ woman, doing a man's job, makes it tough to find an appropriate suitor.\nUna is\
  \ on track to marry Walter Babson, who appears to be a good man but lacks the excitement\
  \ of her eventual husband, Edward Schwirtz. He is a salesman with all the charm\
  \ necessary to win her heart, but the marriage is doomed from the start. Una eventually\
  \ determines to divorce him, which is also scandalous for the time. As the book\
  \ closes, Una emerges triumphant in both her career and her personal life.\nThe\
  \ novel was published before Lewis achieved any significant fame and provides insights\
  \ on working women as well as the unique nature (for the time) of having a woman\
  \ as the lead character.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
